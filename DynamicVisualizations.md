One of the strengths of R is the wealth of data plotting packages. This CRAN Task View maintains a list of dynamic graphics packages, for making animations and interactive plots.

Static plots are not within the scope of this CRAN Task View, neither are graphic devices. Domain-specific packages with merely one or two functions to produce interactive plots or animation may not be included. 

If you think that a package is missing from this list, please let us know through issues or pull requests in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cran-task-views/DynamicVisualizations).

Dynamic visualizations offers the flexibility for users to interact with the plot. This can be useful to query additional details, such as clicking to access information via the pop-ups, or in the context of exploratory data analysis, to view the data across multiple plots through highlighting (brushing). In R, dynamic visualizations are generated by either rendering successive frames in the plots window or interfacing with Javascript libraries through widgets. In this CRAN task view, we first present general purpose packages used to create dynamic visualizations, before reviewing packages tailored for specific purposes, such as maps and networks, as well as those designed for particular plot types, such as parallel coordinate plots.


# General purpose

To generically create linked plots use:

- `r pkg("crosstalk", priority = "core")` creates linked plots for brushing and filtering through a *SharedData* object. 

XXX Explain `htmlwidgets` and `vegawidgets`

The package `ggplot2` has been one of the most widely-used visualization libraries in the R community, however, it is only designed to make static visualizations. The following packages (functions) aim to expand the `ggplot2` paradigm to dynamic visualization: 

- `r pkg("ggiraph", priority = "core")` creates syntax like `geom_xxx_interactive()` to add tool tips and customized interactive effects. 
- The `r pkg("plotly", priority = "core")` package contains the `ggplotly()` function which turns ggplot2 objects directly into interactive plots. XXX Something about other functions for interactive plots in this package XXX refer to Carson Sievert's book. Something about animation too

The majority of the dynamic visualization packages in R interface with the corresponding Javascript libraries. Apart from the `r pkg("r2d3")` package, which requires raw D3 Javascript codes to be bounded to R data objects, most packages create the visualization purely with R codes, requiring little knowledge on Javascript out of the user. One category of packages adopts the *grammar of graphics* thinking to create the plot systematically:

- `r pkg("plotly", priority = "core")` (*plotly.js*) initiates a plot with `plot_ly()` and uses `add_*()` to specify shapes to draw e.g. markers, lines. Axes and legends are controlled by `layout()` and color is controlled by `colorbar()`. Variables in `plotly` is specified with a `~` upfront.
- In `r pkg("echarts4r")` and `r pkg("echarty")` (*echarts.js*), A plot is initialised by `e_charts()` and different plot elements (shapes, axes, theme, etc) are built with the corresponding function starting with `e_`.
- Other packages behave similarly include `r pkg("metricsgraphics")` (*metricsgraphics.js*) and `r pkg("billboarder")` (*billboard.js* )
  
Other packages provide one function for each plot type. This type of functions can be quick to type, while users may find some plot elements difficult to customized. This includes `r pkg("highcharter")` (*highcharts.js*) for plotting a range of native R objects, including `data.frame`, `ts`, `xts`, `forecast`, and `survfit`, `r pkg("googleVis")` (*Google Charts*), `r pkg("rAmCharts")` and `r pkg("rAmCharts4")` (*amcharts.js*).

# Animation

- `r pkg("gganimate", priority = "core")` adds animation to `ggplot2` objects. 
- The `r pkg("plotly", priority = "core")`
- `r pkg("animate")`

# Multivariate

One of the most common visualisations for high dimension data is scatterplot matrix. It can be created with `GGally::ggpairs()` and turned into interactive using `plotly::ggplotly()` to enable linked brushing to view the data at different variable combinations. The `r pkg("pairsD3")` package creates scatterplot matrices through D3 javascript library. 

When the multivariate relationship is attributed to more than two variables, a scatterplot matrix becomes insufficient and a family of technique, called tour, can be useful to explore the structure in high dimensional data. The tour technique animates a sequence of linear projections of high dimensional data and it has two components: 1) tour type: how the projection sequence is generated, and 2) display: how low-D projections are displayed. Different tours are available to select the projection sequences (grand tour: random selection, guided tour: based on projection pursuit, etc). The most common display is histograms for 1D projections and scatterplot for 2D projections. Other higher-D displays are also available, including the Chernoff face. 

- `r pkg("tourr")` implements varies tourr types (`grand_tour`, `guided_tour`, `planned_tour`, `local_tour`, etc) and displays (`animate_xy`: 2D, `animate_dist`: 1D, etc) to create frame-by-frame animation. 
- `r pkg("spinifex")` implements the manual tourr algorithm (`manual_tour`)
- `r pkg("liminal")` implements linked display view to understanding embedding algorithms such as tSNE through `r pkg("vegawidgets")`
- `r pkg("detourr")` implements the 2D and 3D scatterplot display with three.js for better interactive manipulations (rotation, pan, selection, brushing with color and time control)
- `r pkg("langevitour")` implements the langevin dynamics to generate projection sequence and builds the display with D3.js

Another class of interactive visualisation in R is the `r pkg("loon")` toolkit. The graphic system is written in TCL and accessed in R via the `tcltk` package. 

# Temporal

- `r pkg("tsibbletalk")` creates shared `tsibble` objects to produce linked plots of time series, with other data plots using `r pkg("crosstalk", priority = "core")`.
- `r pkg("dygraphs")` (*dygraphs.js*) XXX

# Maps

Various general purpose packages can generate interactive maps:

- plotly XXX

The specialist map package `r pkg("leaflet", priority = "core")` package provides an R interface to the leaflet Javascript library and a collection of packages are available for additional customization:

- `r pkg("leafpop")` allows static plots to be displayed in the leaflet popups,
- `r pkg("leafsync")` displays multiple synced leaflet maps in small multiples,
- `r pkg("leaflegend")` adds customized images as marks and in the legend, 
- `r pkg("leaflet.multiopacity")` provides controls the opacity over different plot layers
- `r pkg("leafem")` supports GIS-related layers, (e.g. Cloud Optimized Geotiff (COG), stars/rasters images), to leaflet map,
- `r pkg("leafgl")` has the capacity to render large scale data (e.g. 1 million points or 100k polygons) in leaflet with the WebGL framework,
- `r pkg("leaflet.minicharts")` renders glyphs on leaflet maps.
- `r pkg("mapedit")` provides interactive editing on leaflet maps
- The `r pkg("tmap")` package provides a new grammar tailored for thematic maps (both static and interactive) and leaflet for interactive map rendering.


For exploratory data analysis, it comes handy to able to create maps quickly with short syntax to plot the geospatial data. 

- `r pkg("mapview")` is such a package for creating quick leaflet and mapdeck maps from common spatial classes in R (`sf`, `raster`, `stars`, etc). 

When working with large scale spatial data, graphic libraries are usually used for rendering maps and this includes 

- `r pkg("mapboxer")` via Mapbox, 
- `r pkg("deckgl")` via Deck.gl, and 
- `r pkg("mapdeck")` via Mapbox GL and Deck.gl.



# Networks and trees

For network diagrams, the most common interactivity needed is to select and highlight connected nodes. Most of the dynamic networks interface with Javascript libraries:  `r pkg("networkD3")` (*D3.js*), `r pkg("visNetwork")` (*vis.js*), and `r pkg("sigmajs")` (*sigma.js*). All three packages can convert native R data frames or igraph objects into network diagrams. The packages `r pkg("networkD3")` and `r pkg("visNetwork")` provide single-line commands for different types of networks, while `r pkg("sigmajs")` builds the networks through a structured grammar approach.

The `r pkg("collapsibleTree")` package allows users to click on tree nodes to expand and collapse complex trees through D3.js in the backend.

# Miscellaneous

R also includes packages dedicated to specific interactive visualizations, often by interfacing with relevant JavaScript libraries.

  - small multiples: `r pkg("trelliscopejs")` (*trelliscope.js*) 
  - heatmap: `r pkg("heatmaply")` (*plotly.js*), `r pkg("d3heatmap")` (*D3.js*), `r pkg("iheatmapr")` (*plotly.js*).
  - parallel coordinate plot: `r pkg("parallelPlot")` (*d3.js*)
  - timeline: `r pkg("timevis")` (*vis.js*) 
  - upset plot: `r pkg("upsetjs")` (*upset.js*)
