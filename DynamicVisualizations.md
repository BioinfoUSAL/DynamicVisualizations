The wealth of graphics packages in R makes it easy to plot data, models and create conceptual illustrations. This CRAN Task View maintains a list of the dynamic graphics packages, for making animations and interactive plots.

Static plots are not within the scope of this CRAN Task View, neither are graphics devices. Some packages that include only one or two functions to produce interactive plots or animations but are mostly focused on modeling methods or applications are mostly not included. 

If you think that a package is missing from this list, you can post an issue or directly add using a pull request in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cran-task-views/DynamicVisualizations).

Dynamic visualizations include interactive graphics which offer the flexibility for users to interact with the plot, with mouse or cursor selection, for example. This can be useful to query additional details, such as using mouse-over to provide additional information about a point or line in the plot. For exploratory data analysis, it is beneficial to view and link multiple plots using highlighting or brushing. Most interactivity is provided by interfacing R with external libraries like JavaScript (JS). Dynamic visualizations also include animations which are generated by rendering successive frames in the plot window.  

The listed packages are grouped into general purpose and those designed for specific applications, such as maps and networks, or for particular plot types, such as parallel coordinate plots.

# General purpose

Under the hood, the package `r pkg("htmlwidgets")` and `r pkg("vegawidget")` interface R with external JS libraries. These packages are used as a foundation by many other packages. From the user perspective, these frameworks are used to transform the R code into JS visualizations. Specifically, when creating a package interfacing JS, developers need to write 1) R bindings to convert your R code into a widget and 2) JavaScript bindings to link the widget to the imported JS libraries. This is indicated on the package list by specifying the JS library in parentheses (*XXX.js*). 

The following two packages are generally useful for creating interactive plots in R:

- the `r pkg("crosstalk", priority = "core")` package enables linked brushing across multiple plots from `htmlwidgets`. It operates via a SharedData object in the R6 class and is theoretically applicable to all the `htmlwidgets` created by various packages. Currently supported graphics packages include `plotly`, `leaflet`, and `rgl`. Developers of interactive graphics packages should consider integrating `crosstalk` within their packages to support linked brushing. 

- the `r pkg("r2d3")` package that binds raw D3 JS codes to R data objects. This gives you full customization on the interactive details but requires the skill to write JS code.

The following packages can all create interactive graphics of basic types, including scatterplots, bar charts, histograms et). Most packages offer support to highlight plot elements (dots, bars, lines, etc) and display tooltips upon hovering. This review includes the syntax usage of each package, as well as the additional plot types (map, network diagram, etc) and interactive actions supported. 

- The `r pkg("plotly", priority = "core")` package (*plotly.js*) contains the `ggplotly()` function which turns ggplot2 objects directly into interactive plots. Plots can also be created using native plotly syntax: initialize with `plot_ly()`, specify shapes (markers, lines, etc) through `add_*()`, control axes and legends with `layout()`, and color with `colorbar()`. Variables in `plotly` is specified with a `~` upfront. Every `plotly` plot includes the toolbar to allow panning, box/lasso selection, (selected) zoom in/out, and saving. It also supports brushed linking across multiple data plots, and a common use case is in scatterplot matrices. When a portion of the data is selected in one panel, it will be highlighted simultaneously across all the panels. Animation through `plotly` is introduced under the *Animation* section. More on `plotly` from Carson Sievert's book [Interactive web-based data visualization with R, plotly, and shiny](https://plotly-r.com/). (support clicking on the legend for show/ hide categories)

- The `r pkg("ggiraph", priority = "core")` package aims to expand the `ggplot2` paradigm to dynamic visualization by introducing an interactive version of geoms: `geom_xxx_interactive()`. It supports panning, zooming, lasso selection, and adding png download button through the toolbar.

- In `r pkg("echarts4r")` (*echarts.js*), a plot is initialized by `e_charts()` and different plot elements (shapes, axes, theme, etc) are built with the `e_*` functions, e.g. `e_line()`, `e_axis_labels()`, `e_theme()`. It covers most basic chart types, statistical graphics(confidence band, correlation matrix, etc), geospatial maps, some timeline (time series) displays, and network diagrams. WebGL render is also supported, as well as using customized icons/ pictures in the plot. A unique interactive action supported by the package is to drag either end of the color/fill legend to filter the data within the range on the plot (see `e_visual_map()`).

- In `r pkg("billboarder")` (*billboard.js* ), a plot is initialized by `billboarder()` and plot elements (shape, axes, legend, etc) are specified through `bb_*()` functions. Zooming on the time series plot is supported by selecting the main plot (`bb_zoom()`) or a subchart (`bb_subchart()`) 

- In `r pkg("highcharter")` (*highcharts.js*), a plot is initialized by `hchart()` or built with `hc_add_series()`. Support on plot elements (legend, color, axis, etc) are adjusted through `hc_*()` functions. It also supports maps, network diagrams, and statistical plots (e.g. PCA plot after `princomp()`, correlation matrix). For temporal plots, it supports linked tracking across multiple series and zooming at various scales, through button clicking or dragging on the subchart. It also supports clicking to view the treemap at different hierarchical levels. 

- `r pkg("googleVis")` (*Google Charts*) uses plot type like `gvis[ChartType]()` to specify the plot, e.g. `gvisScatterChart()`. Additional controls of plot elements are passed as a list of `options` inside the main function. It supports creating maps, interactive tables, treemaps, network and sankey diagrams, and calendar plots. 

- `r pkg("rAmCharts")` and `r pkg("rAmCharts4")` (*amcharts.js*) uses plot type syntax `amChartType()` to specify the plot. It supports the selection of multiple datasets through the selection box, see `amStockMultiSet()`. 

- `r pkg("tcltk")` provides access to the platform-independent Tcl scripting language and Tk GUI elements, forming the basis for other packages. 

- `r pkg("rgl")` provides 3D visualisations built with OpenGL or WebGL as the rendering backend.

# Animation

- `r pkg("gganimate", priority = "core")` extends the grammar of graphics in `ggplot2` to describe animations.
- `r pkg("plotly", priority = "core")` also supports animation. When created from a ggplot object, a `frame` and `ids` aesthetic needs to be specified: i.e. `gg <- ggplot() + geom_point(aes(frame = xxx, ids = xxx)); ggplotly(gg)`. In the plotly syntax, the `animation_*` functions are used to create animations.
- `r pkg("animate")` provides general purpose animation including generating maze, playing chess, and animating info vis, using the base R syntax.

# Multivariate

One of the most common visualisations for high dimension data is scatterplot matrix. It can be created with `GGally::ggpairs()` and turned into interactive using `plotly::ggplotly()` to enable linked brushing to view the data at different variable combinations. 

- The `r pkg("pairsD3")` package creates scatterplot matrices through D3 JS library. 

When the multivariate relationship is attributed to more than two variables, a scatterplot matrix becomes insufficient and a family of technique, called tour, can be useful to explore the structure in high dimensional data. The tour technique animates a sequence of linear projections of high dimensional data and it has two components: 1) tour type: how the projection sequence is generated, and 2) display: how low-D projections are displayed. Different tours are available to select the projection sequences (grand tour: random selection, guided tour: based on projection pursuit, etc). The most common display is histograms for 1D projections and scatterplot for 2D projections. Other higher-D displays are also available, including the Chernoff face. 

- `r pkg("tourr")` implements varies tourr types (`grand_tour`, `guided_tour`, `planned_tour`, `local_tour`, etc) and displays (`animate_xy`: 2D, `animate_dist`: 1D, etc) to create frame-by-frame animation. 
- `r pkg("spinifex")` implements the manual tourr algorithm (`manual_tour`).
- `r pkg("liminal")` implements linked display view to understanding embedding algorithms such as tSNE through `r pkg("vegawidgets")`.
- `r pkg("detourr")` implements the 2D and 3D scatterplot display with three.js for better interactive manipulations (rotation, pan, selection, brushing with color and time control).
- `r pkg("langevitour")` implements the langevin dynamics to generate projection sequence and builds the display with D3.js.
- `r pkg("woylier")` implements the Given interpolation method to generate projection sequences for rotation variant projection pursuit indexes (those index values change when rotating the projection within the plane), e.g. the spline index.
- `r pkg("ferrn")` provides diagnostic plots (track index values and visualize the basis space) to the optimisation routine of the projection pursuit guided tour.

Another class of interactive visualisation in R is the `r pkg("loon")` toolkit. The graphic system is written in TCL and accessed in R via the `tcltk` package. 

# Temporal

- `r pkg("tsibbletalk")` creates shared `tsibble` objects to produce linked plots of time series, with other data plots using `r pkg("crosstalk", priority = "core")`.
- `r pkg("dygraphs")` (*dygraphs.js*) creates interactive time series plots for `xts` objects and supports a range of features, including series highlights, value tracking, annotating event and confidence interval, range selection, and rolling window smoothing.

# Maps

## General purpose packages 

- The `r pkg("plotly")` package provides functionality for general-purpose interactive maps that fit into the plotly ecosystem, supporting features like linked brushing. Simple, quick basemaps can be created with the `plot_mapbox()` and `plot_geo()` constructor. For more complex, data-driven maps (e.g. with `sf`), use the `plot_ly()` constructor or `ggplotly()` on a `ggplot2` object.

- The `r pkg("ggiraph")` package supports converting `ggplot2` objects into interactive graphs. It allows flexible customisation options for interactivity, including tooltip text, onclick effects, CSS for hover and select, allowing additional information to be incorporated into the visualization (e.g. linking to an external website upon clicking).

- The `r pkg("highcharter")` package supports maps created from data frames/ tibble and the `geo_json` class from the `geojsonio` package. It allows customizatin of tooltips and enables legend clicking to show or hide categories. 

## Specialized map packages

### The leaflet family

The `r pkg("leaflet", priority = "core")` package is one of the most popular JS libraries for interactive maps. It supports creating maps for a wide range of R objects, including data frames, sf, GeoJSON/TopoJSON, raster images from the `terra` or `raster` packages. The package allows flexible customization of display and interactive options: enhencing tooltips and labels with CSS, changing basemap styles and showing/hideing layers through clicking the legend, customized marker icons via URL links and Font Awesome, a variety of basemap options, (including Open Street Map, Stamen, Stadia, ESRI, and customized map tiles), distance and area calculation from clicking points on the map (with `addMeasure()`), a mini global map for zooming, just to name a few. Leaflet maps can cross-talk with other interactive visualizations through the `r pkg("crosstalk")` package. The ecosystem is further enhanced through plugins:

- `r pkg("leafpop")` displays static plots in the tooltip popups,
- `r pkg("leafsync")` displays multiple synced leaflet maps in small multiples,
- `r pkg("leaflet.minicharts")` displays glyphs (pie and bar), with animation, on the map.
- `r pkg("leaflegend")` adds customized images as marks and in the legend, 
- `r pkg("leaflet.multiopacity")` provides controls the opacity over different plot layers
- `r pkg("leafem")` supports GIS-related layers, (e.g. Cloud Optimized Geotiff (COG), stars/rasters images)
- `r pkg("leafgl")` renders large scale data (e.g. 1 million points or 100k polygons) with the WebGL framework,

### Others

- The `r pkg("tmap")` package provides a ggplot2-styled grammar of graphic for thematic maps (both static and interactive) and uses leaflet to render interactive maps. 
- The `r pkg("mapview")` package creates quick leaflet and mapdeck maps with short syntax from common spatial classes in R such as `sf`, `raster` and `stars`.
- The `r pkg("mapboxer")` package interfaces with Mapbox GL JS to create interactive maps. It leverages resources from the JS library for basemap styles, aesthetics controls, interactive controls, including interactive filtering ("expressions") and point clustering. 
- The `r pkg("deckgl")` package interfaces with deckgl for interactive maps. It offers an interactive editor to fine tune the map (`add_json_editor()`).
- The `r pkg("mapdeck")` package interactive visualization for large data sets via Mapbox GL and Deck.gl. It supports a wider set of objects including data frame, sf (sfencoded, sfencodedLite), geojson/json/GeoJSON.

# Networks

Packages are available for plotting simple networks:

- The `r pkg("sigmajs")` package has its own grammar for constructing network diagrams. It supports data structure from `igraph` and `gexf` and can use various `igraph` layouts to display the network. The package has also implemented plugins from the `sigma.js`, which includes highlight neighbour nodes and apply customised images for nodes.
- The `r pkg("networkD3")` package (*D3.js*) produces simple/force network, sankey diagram, dendrogram. The visualization can be created from `igraph` objects.
- The `r pkg("visNetwork")` package (*vis.js*) creates network diagrams through node and edge data frames. It support visualizing classification tree results from the `rpart` package.
- The `r pkg("collapsibleTree")` package creates collapsible tree diagram to visualise hierarchical data structures based on D3.js. It supports clicking on tree nodes to expand and collapse child nodes, as well as tooltips and zooming.


# Miscellaneous

R also includes packages dedicated to specific interactive visualizations, often by interfacing with relevant JS libraries.

- The `r pkg("trelliscopejs")` package (*trelliscope.js*) enables the interactive visualization of small multiples, making it particularly suitable for visualising large collections of multiples that cannot be displayed on a single screen through facets. The package offers `facet_trelliscope()`, as a drop-in replacement for  `facet_wrap/grid()`, as well as  `trelliscope()`, a more general function that fits into the tidy workflow where data transformation(compute summaries, models, etc) can be handled by nested data and list-column. 
- heatmap: 
  - The `r pkg("heatmaply")` package (*plotly.js*) allows interactive heatmaps with actions like cell-hover tooltips and zooming into specific areas. It supports data transformation such as scaling, normalizing, and percentizing, and the dendrograms for viewing the structure of observations can be customized using the `dendextend` package.
  - The `r pkg("iheatmapr")` package (*plotly.js*) supports heatmaps with more complex subplots in addition to clustering dendrograms. It includes annotations for group categories and customizable plots for row and column summary statistics. It also supports displaying multiple heatmaps side-by-side. 
- The `r pkg("parallelPlot")` package (*d3.js*) creates Parallel Coordinate Plot (PCP) and scatterplot matrix with linked brushing to hightlight points and ranges on the PCP axis.
- The `r pkg("timevis")` package (*vis.js*) creates timeline visualisation for project management and event scheduling. It support dragging and zooming on the time axis and is compatible with crosstalk for linked brushing.
